'''
Restaurant Reservation System : Design a reservation system for a restuarant
where each table's reservation list is represented as a queue of reservations.
New reservations are added to the appropriate table's queue based on factors 
like reservation time and table availablity. Utilize a combination of queues 
within a larger data structure for efficient reservation management.
